Anti-spam proof-of-concept on based on Solana's multi-signature transactions. 

Thesis: Website and communities want to offer trustworthy users privileged access and are willing to pay for it through their anti-spam and moderation budgets. Users are willing to prove themselves by presenting signed credentials, but are not willing to pay for it. 

Solution: This service demonstrates how Solana's multi-signature feature can be used to let a site's wallet pay to post a user's verification result, signed by both a verification oracle and the user, to Solana.
